<h1> My First Website </h1>

 <br>So... Yeah! This website depends solely upon whoever cares, namely Preptech and I.

 <br>Ok, this is an update, it has been a couple of months now since I made this website, and I haven't been on it much. It is the holiday season and it is currently a Wednesday. At the end of the week we will <b>FINALLY</b> have break, which will be a relief. Until then, this is Arek Ouzounian as of December 16, 2015 at 8:32 PM, signing off.
<br><b>3/9/16</b> <br><b>UPDATE:</b> It is currently the ninth of March, and we are 3 months into the new year. Midterms have passed, and I am late into the third quarter of the school year. Until next time, this is Arek Ouzounian, Signing Off.
